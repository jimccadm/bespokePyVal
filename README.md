# LLM Response Validator

This repository consists of three Python scripts that demonstrate how to use two different Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating answers to human questions and validating the sufficiency of the answers.

## Overview

This project utilizes two scripts to interact with LLMs via the `ollama` Python package:
1. **`questionllm.py`**: Sends a human question to a LLM (`llama3.2:3b`) to generate an answer.
2. **`validatorllm.py`**: Validates the LLM response using a different model (`bespoke-minicheck:latest`), checking if the answer sufficiently responds to the human's question.
3. **`app.py`**: Combines the functionality of both scripts, allowing you to ask a question and then validate the generated response.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `app.py`
This is the main script that ties everything together. It takes a human question, generates a response using the `questionllm.py` script, and then validates the response using the `validatorllm.py` script. Finally, the result of the validation is printed.

**Example Code:**
```python
from questionllm import chat
from validatorllm import validator

human_qstn = "In one paragraph only, why did Germany invade Europe on World War 2?"
llm_output = chat(human_qstn)
validvalue = validator(human_qstn, llm_output)
print(validvalue)
```

### 2. `questionllm.py`
This script is responsible for interacting with the `llama3.2:3b` LLM. It takes a human question as input and returns the generated answer from the LLM.

**Example Code:**
```python
import ollama

def chat(question):
    print(question)
    response = ollama.chat(model='llama3.2:3b', messages=[
        {
            'role': 'user',
            'content': question,
        },
    ])
    return(response['message']['content'])
```

### 3. `validatorllm.py`
This script is used to validate the LLM's response to a given question. It forms a validation query that asks if the response is sufficient. The validation is done using another LLM model (`bespoke-minicheck:latest`).

**Example Code:**
```python
import ollama

def validator(question, llm_response):
    q_Validator = f"Has {llm_response} as a response to the human question {question} provided a sufficient response?"
    combi_qanda = "Human Question:" + question + " LLM Answer was:" + llm_response
    print("****\n" + combi_qanda)

    response = ollama.chat(model='bespoke-minicheck:latest', messages=[
        {
            'role': 'user',
            'content': q_Validator,
        },
    ])
    return(response['message']['content'])
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-response-validator.git
   cd llm-response-validator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the `ollama` Python package (or any other necessary dependencies):
   ```bash
   pip install ollama
   ```

3. **Set Up LLM Models**:
   Ensure you have access to the `llama3.2:3b` and `bespoke-minicheck:latest` models from the `ollama` service.

## Usage

1. **Run the Main Script**:
   To use the combined functionality of generating a response and validating it, run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Example Output**:
   When you run the script, it will:
   - Print the question.
   - Generate a response from the LLM.
   - Validate the response.
   - Print the result of the validation (whether the LLM's answer was sufficient).
